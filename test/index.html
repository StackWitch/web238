  <h1>My Semester Project</h1>
  
  <h2>Topic</h2>
  <p>
    I am creating a website that helps calculate what time you need to leave to go to the airport. 
    The goal is to keep it clean, simple, and easy to use.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Inspiration Website</h2>
  <p>
    My inspiration is <a href="https://www.google.com/flights/" target="_blank">Google Flights</a>. 
    I like the minimal, uncluttered design, the simple interface, and the way it guides the user without confusion. 
    I plan to bring those same qualities into my project.
